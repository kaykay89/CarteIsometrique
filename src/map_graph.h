/**
 * Module map_graph
 *
 * This module is responsible of handling graphs representing maps.
 *
 * A graph is a common data structure used to represent networks. It is
 * completely determined by its vertices (or nodes) and the edges (or links)
 * between the nodes.
 *
 * In our case, we represent an isometric map by a graph whose nodes are
 * exactly the cells that are free (i.e. there is no cell above the tile),
 * meaning that we can "move" on this cell. Also, there is an edge (a link)
 * between two cells if it is possible to move from one cell to the other. The
 * interest of representing a map by a graph is that one can, in particular,
 * compute a path between two cells in the map.
 *
 * The module provides four data structures:
 *
 * - ``struct MapCell``, representing a cell in the map;
 * - ``struct MapCellNode``, representing a node in the graph;
 * - ``struct MapGraph``, representing the graph of a map;
 * - ``struct MapGraphPath``, representing a path from one cell to another in
 *   the graph.
